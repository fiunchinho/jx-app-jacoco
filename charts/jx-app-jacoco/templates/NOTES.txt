To check the status of {{ .Chart.Name }}, try:

    $ helm status {{ .Chart.Name }}

Once 'jx get apps' (https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/2976) is implemented this can also be achieved using
the jx CLI directly:

    $ jx get app  {{ .Chart.Name }}

Once installed {{ .Chart.Name }} will attach a JaCoCo code coverage fact to each PipelineActivity custom resource
which has run the JaCoCo Maven Plug-in.

You can get a list of the existing PipelineActivity custom resources via:

    $ kubectl get act

To inspect the attached coverage fact for a given PipelineActivity:

    $ kubectl get act -o yaml <org>-<repo>-pr-<pull-request-number>-<build-number>
